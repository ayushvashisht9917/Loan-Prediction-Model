# Loan-Prediction-Model
Built an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to predict loan repayment probability using a synthetic tabular dataset. Performed data preprocessing, feature engineering (target encoding), model training with LightGBM and CatBoost, K-Fold cross-validation, and model blending to optimize ROC-AUC.
